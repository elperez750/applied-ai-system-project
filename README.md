# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

### Song Features

Each `Song` object stores: `id`, `title`, `artist`, `genre`, `mood`, `energy` (0–1), `tempo_bpm`, `valence` (0–1), `danceability` (0–1), and `acousticness` (0–1).

### User Profile

The `UserProfile` holds:
- `favorite_genre` — the genre the user most wants to hear
- `favorite_mood` — the emotional vibe the user is after (e.g. `happy`, `chill`, `intense`)
- `target_energy` — a 0–1 float representing how high-energy the user wants songs to be
- `likes_acoustic` — a boolean that unlocks a small bonus for acoustic-heavy songs

**Critique / differentiation note:** A profile with `favorite_genre = "rock"` and `favorite_mood = "intense"` will rank *Storm Runner* (rock, intense, energy 0.91) far above *Library Rain* (lofi, chill, energy 0.35), even though both could score some energy-similarity points. The combination of a categorical genre match (+2.0) and a categorical mood match (+1.0) is strong enough to separate those two clusters clearly. A purely energy-based profile would blur that line, but the categorical fields keep them distinct.

### Algorithm Recipe

For every song in the catalog, the system computes a score:

| Rule | Points |
|---|---|
| `song.genre == user.favorite_genre` | **+2.0** |
| `song.mood == user.favorite_mood` | **+1.0** |
| Energy closeness: `1.0 - abs(song.energy - user.target_energy)` | **0.0 – 1.0** |
| Acoustic bonus (only when `likes_acoustic=True` and `song.acousticness >= 0.70`) | **+0.5** |

Maximum possible score: **4.5**

Songs are then sorted highest-to-lowest and the top `k` (default 5) are returned.

**Potential bias to watch for:** Genre carries the most weight (+2.0). A song with the right genre but the wrong mood will still outscore a perfect-mood, wrong-genre song. This means the system may over-prioritize genre and miss emotionally fitting songs from adjacent genres (e.g., a great *indie pop* track when the user asked for *pop*).

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this


---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
